King's Court VR is a VR tower defense prototype containing the basic features of a tabletop defense game, where the user can purchase towers with gold rewarded
from kills in order to protect the king at the center of the board. The towers can be picked up and placed on any unoccupied square on the board.
If the tower is placed in any unavailable location it will return to its original spawn point outside of the board. As the levels progress the enemies
spawn faster and the towers become more expensive after each purchase. When the game is over the user will be able to return to the main menu to start a 
new game or quit the application.

Controls:
Use the trigger on either controller to navigate the menu.
Use the grip in combination with the joystick to place the towers in the play area.
Use the right joystick to turn and the left to move around the play area.
